# Migrating Apps from Angular 1 to Angular 2

This sample application demonstrates some of the basics of migrating from Angular 1 to Angular 2.

## Getting Started

First, you want to make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed so you can start the personal web server. 

Next, clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/craigshoemaker/angular-migration-demo.git

Then, install the dependencies:

    npm install

Once everything is installed you can launch the application in your default browser by running:

    npm start

\* On Windows, an alternative to the above steps would be to double click on `instal.cmd` and then `start.cmd`.
